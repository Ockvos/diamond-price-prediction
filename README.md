# Diamond Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This notebook attempts to predict diamond prices using a neural network. The model was trained using a dataset containing roughly 54,000 diamond sales. Accuracy was measured using mean absolute error (MAE) and r-squared (R2). A detailed explanation is located within the notebook itself. 

The recommended approach is to build the notebook using the Binder link. The link will launch an interactive version of the notebook (building the image can take several minutes). The notebook can also be viewed statically by clicking directly on the <a href="https://github.com/Ockvos/diamond-price-prediction/blob/main/diamond_mlp.ipynb">diamond_mlp.ipynb</a> file in the repository.

Once the notebook has launched, click the **“Run”** button located on the menu bar, scroll down, and click **“Run All Cells”**. This action will run through all the code, building the model from scratch, and allowing full interactivity.
